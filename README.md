# GetLinked Hackathon Challenge Website


Welcome to the GetLinked Hackathon Challenge website! ðŸš€

Have you ever wondered what happens when you combine the power of Figma designs, APIs, Redux for state management, smooth scrolling, GSAP animations, Framer Motion page transitions, and a custom cursor-following circle? No? Well, neither did I, but here we are!

## Introduction

This website is the result of countless hours of caffeinated coding during the GetLinked Hackathon Challenge. The challenge was simple: take the Figma designs shared with us and turn them into a living, breathing website. But why stop at simple when you can go above and beyond?

## Features

### 1. Figma Design Magic

I took those beautiful Figma designs and turned them into a reality. Every pixel is where it's supposed to be, thanks to the magic of CSS and HTML.

### 2. API Awesomeness

Who doesn't love data? I integrated some cool APIs that provide real-time information, making the website not only beautiful but also informative.

### 3. Redux for State Sorcery

Managing state has never been this smooth. Redux ensures that the data flows seamlessly through the website, making everything more flexible and organized.

### 4. Smooth Scrolling

Scrolling through the website feels like a breeze. No more jerky jumps â€“ just pure, smooth scrolling goodness.

### 5. GSAP Animations

GSAP brings life to the website with captivating animations. It's like the website is dancing just for you.

### 6. Framer Motion Page Transitions

Moving from one page to another is a delightful experience with Framer Motion. The transitions are so smooth; you'll want to visit every page just to see them in action.

### 7. Custom Cursor Fun

My favorite part of the website? The custom cursor that follows your every move! It adds a touch of fun and interactivity to your browsing experience. Try not to get distracted!

## How It Works

The website is built using React and Redux for state management. To get started, follow the installation instructions below.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone`.

2. Navigate to the project directory.

3. Install the project dependencies using:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

Once the installation is complete, you can run the website locally using:

```
npm start
```

Explore the website, check out the smooth scrolling, enjoy the animations, and don't forget to play around with the custom cursor!

## Contributing

I welcome contributions, whether it's fixing a bug, improving the design, or adding new features. Feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request â€“ let's make this website even more awesome together!
